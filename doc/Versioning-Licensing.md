Versioning & Licensing - Piwi-Bash-Library
==========================================

This document describes the best practice to build version numbers (for package releases)
and license informations.


## Versioning

The construction of version numbers MUST follow the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/)
rules to be compliant with standards.

Give your scripts a version number is, of course, not an obligation. But it can be very
useful to identify evolutions and compare an actual version to yours. The library itself
uses a version number constructed following the Semantice versioning: `X.Y.Z` where `X`
is the major version reference, `Y` is a minor version number and `Z` the last bugfix version.

Once it has been published, a release MUST NOT (never !!) change its version number.


## Licensing

The library is licensed under the [General Public License version 3.0](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).
