ROADMAP - Piwi-Bash-Library
===========================

## TODO

-   skip the 'libhelp' option (which have no real meanin) to prefer the manpage
-   the output of 'version' may follow GNU specs:

    GNU hello 2.3
    Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
    License GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later <http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>
    This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
    There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

-   skip the 'libdoc' option ; it just can be invoked by calling the lib itself
