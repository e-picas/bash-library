.SH DESCRIPTION

.PP
\fBBash\fP, the "\fIBourne-Again-SHell\fP", is a \fIUnix shell\fP written for the GNU Project as a
free software replacement of the original Bourne shell (sh). The present library is a tool
for Bash scripts facilities. To use the library, just include its source file using:
`\fSsource path/to/piwi-bash-library.bash\fP` and call its methods.

.PP
The library is NOT a script doing some work itself except dealing with a copy of the library
; it is just a library. This manual explains the library itself, its options and
usage methods but you MAY keep in mind that the final manual page to read is the one of
the real script you will call, using the tools of the library to build its own work. See the
"Interface" section of this manual for information about the library interface (when calling
it directly).

.PP
The following features are available using the library:

.RS

.IP \(bu 
some common methods to work with strings and arrays in Bash

.IP \(bu 
a management of information messages like warnings and errors

.IP \(bu 
a management of a simple \fIhelp or usage information\fP for each script (just defining some variables
in the script)

.IP \(bu 
the creation of some \fIcolorized and stylized content\fP for terminal output: some methods are designed
to wrap a string between colored or styled tags, according to the current system,
and to build a colorized content using XML-like tags (`\fS<mytag>my content</mytag>\fP`)

.IP \(bu 
a management of a \fIconfiguration dotfile\fP for a script: some methods allow you to read, write,
update and delete configuration values in a file

.IP \(bu 
a management of \fItemporary files\fP and \fIlog files\fP

.IP \(bu 
a set of \fIcommon options\fP (described in next "Options" section) to let the user interact
with the script, such as increase or decrease verbosity, make a dry run, ask to force 
commands or to always prompt for confirmation

.RE

.PP
For the library source code and messages outputs, we mostly try to follow the
GNU coding standards <http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/standards.html> to keep user in
a known environment ...

.SS INTERFACE

.PP
When calling the library script itself from command line, a user interface is available to
deal (install/update/uninstall) with a copy of the library locally or globally in your 
system (3rd synopsis form). To start with this interface, you can run:
.RS

.EX
path/to/piwi-bash-library.bash (--less) help
.EE
.RE

.PP
A basic synopsis of the interface is:
.RS

.EX
path/to/piwi-bash-library.bash -[common options] --target=path --preset=default action-name
.EE
.RE

.PP
See the "Options" section below for specific options usage.

.SS The following actions are available
.TP
\fBcheck\fP
check if your library is up-to-date
.TP
\fBdocumentation\fP
see the library documentation ; use option `\fSverbose\fP` to increase verbosity ; you can
add an `\fSmd\fP` prefix to get the documentation in Markdown format ('mddocumentation')
.TP
\fBhelp\fP and \fBusage\fP
get an 'help' and 'usage' information about the library
.TP
\fBinstall\fP
install a copy of the library locally or in your system
.TP
\fBuninstall\fP
uninstall a copy from a system path
.TP
\fBupdate\fP
update the library with a newer version if so ; this will update the MINOR version
.TP
\fBversion\fP
get the version information about the library ; use option `\fSquiet\fP` to get only
the version number
.SH OPTIONS

.PP
Each script depending on the library may define its own options. Report to the script
manpage or help string for more information.

.PP
\fIThe following common options are supported (MAY be used first):\fP
.TP
\fB--dry-run\fP
see commands to run but do not run them actually ; this will define the environment variables
`\fSDRYRUN\fP` on `\fStrue\fP` and `\fSINTERACTIVE\fP` and `\fSFORCED\fP` on `\fSfalse\fP`
.TP
\fB-f\fP, \fB--force\fP
force some commands to not prompt confirmation ; this will define the environment
variables `\fSFORCED\fP` on `\fStrue\fP` and `\fSVERBOSE\fP` and `\fSDEBUG\fP` on `\fSfalse\fP`
.TP
\fB-h\fP, \fB--help\fP
show an information message 
.TP
\fB-i\fP, \fB--interactive\fP
ask for confirmation before any action ; this will define the environment variables
`\fSINTERACTIVE\fP` on `\fStrue\fP` and `\fSFORCED\fP` on `\fSfalse\fP`
.TP
\fB--libversion\fP
see the library version ; use option `\fS--quiet\fP` to only have the version number
.TP
\fB--log\fP =filename
define the log filename to use (default is `\fSpwibashlib.log\fP`) ; this will update
the environment variable `\fSLOGFILE\fP`
.TP
\fB--man\fP
try to open a manpage for current script if available, or show the help string otherwise
.TP
\fB-q\fP, \fB--quiet\fP
decrease script verbosity, nothing will be written unless errors ; this will define
the environment variables `\fSVERBOSE\fP` on `\fSfalse\fP` and `\fSQUIET\fP` on `\fStrue\fP`
.TP
\fB-v\fP, \fB--verbose\fP
increase script verbosity ; this will define the environment variables `\fSVERBOSE\fP` on `\fStrue\fP`
and `\fSQUIET\fP` on `\fSfalse\fP`
.TP
\fB-V\fP, \fB--version\fP
see the script version when available ; use option `\fS--quiet\fP` to only have the version number
.TP
\fB--working-dir\fP =path
redefine the working directory (default is `\fSpwd\fP` - `\fSpath\fP` must exist) ; this will update
the environment variable `\fSWORKINGDIR\fP`
.TP
\fB-x\fP, \fB--debug\fP
enable debug mode ; this will define the environment variables `\fSDEBUG\fP` and `\fSVERBOSE\fP` on `\fStrue\fP`
and `\fSQUIET\fP` on `\fSfalse\fP`
.TP
\fB--usage\fP
show a quick usage information
.PP
You can group short options like `\fS-xc\fP`, set an option argument like `\fS-d(=)value\fP` or
`\fS--long=value\fP` and use `\fS--\fP` to explicitly specify the end of the script options.
Options are treated in the command line order (`\fS-vq\fP` will finally retain `\fS-q\fP`).

.PP
You can mix short options, long options and script arguments at your convenience.

.PP
In some cases, you can use an automatic long option named as a program like `\fS--less\fP` for the
"less" program. If this program is installed in the system, it will be used for certain
option rendering. For instance, a long "help" output can be loaded via `\fSless\fP` running:
.RS

.EX
piwi-bash-library-script -h --less
.EE
.RE

.SS Specific options of the library's interface

.PP
Calling the library script itself to use its interface, you can use the following options:
.TP
\fB-b\fP, \fB--branch\fP =name
defines the GIT branch to use from the remote repository ; the branch MUST exist in the
repository ; it defaults to "\fImaster\fP"
.TP
\fB-e\fP, \fB--exec\fP ='bash string to evaluate'
a bash raw script string to evaluate in library's environment ; the execution will stop
after the `\fSevaluate\fP` process (exclusive action) and exit with its last status

\fB--local\fP
defines the current directory as target directory (alias of `\fS-t=pwd\fP`)
.TP

files to install ; see the "Files" section below for more information
.TP
\fB-r\fP, \fB--release\fP =version
