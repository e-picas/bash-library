.SH DESCRIPTION

.PP
\fBBash\fP, the "\fIBourne-Again-SHell\fP", is a \fIUnix shell\fP written for the GNU Project as a
free software replacement for the original Bourne shell (sh). The present library is a tool
for Bash scripts facilities. To use the library, just include its source file using:
`\fSsource path/to/bash-library.sh\fP` and call its methods.

.PP
The library is NOT a script doing some work itself ; it is just a library. So running it
directly may not do anything. This manual explains the library itself, its options and
usage methods but you MAY keep in mind that the final manual page to read is the one of
the real script you will call, using the tools of the library to build its own work.

.PP
The following features are available using the library:

.RS

.IP \(bu 
some common methods to work with strings and arrays in Bash

.IP \(bu 
manage information messages like warnings and errors

.IP \(bu 
manage a simple \fBhelp or usage information\fP for each script (just defining some variables
in this script)

.IP \(bu 
create some \fBcolorized and styled content\fP for terminal output: some methods are designed
to wrap a string between colored or styled tags, according to the current system running,
and to build a colorized content using XML-like tags (`\fS<mytag>my content</mytag>\fP`)

.IP \(bu 
manage a \fBconfiguration dotfile\fP for a script: some methods allows you to read, write,
update and delete configuration values in a file

.IP \(bu 
manage \fBtemporary files\fP and \fBlog files\fP

.IP \(bu 
use a set of \fBcommon options\fP (described in next section) to let the user interact
with the script, such as increase or decrease verbosity, make a dry run, ask to force 
commands or to always prompt for confirmation
